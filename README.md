# Paralax-website
This project showcases a parallax scrolling effect using only HTML and CSS ✨. Background images move slower than the foreground, adding depth 🎨. The code is simple and easy to understand 📚. Note: this design is not responsive ⚠️ and may require adjustments for different devices. Open index.html in your browser to view it! 🚀
